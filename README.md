# ovpn2onc
Convert OpenVPN config files to the ONC ChromeOS network config files.

## How to use
Download the `ovpn2onc.html` file and open it in Chrome (or any other modern browser). Follow the instructions there.

You can also use the hosted copy at [https://thomkeh.github.io/ovpn2onc/ovpn2onc](https://thomkeh.github.io/ovpn2onc/ovpn2onc)
but be aware that in this case your configuration (with keys) will be sent over the Internet and you have to trust the website.
